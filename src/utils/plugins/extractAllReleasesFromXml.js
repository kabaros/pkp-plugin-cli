 *
 * The function loops through the plugins and their releases and creates a text file containing a list
 * of the releases and their MD5 sums This is then consument by the bash script "checkMD5sum" that
 * downloads all the releases and compares their MD5 sums with the content of the generated file
 *
 * @param {string} filePath the path to the file to parse and extract the releases info from
