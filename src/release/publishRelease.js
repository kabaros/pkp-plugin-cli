 * @brief Helper for building a release (used by pkp-plugin release command)
 *
 * This helper is the actual entry point for the operations performed by the command.
 * It was abstracted in a separate module to separate from parsing command lines argument
 * in cases where the command is executed when prompted after running pkp-plugin bump
 * (as opposed to when it's run with pkp-plugin release newversion 2.0.0)
