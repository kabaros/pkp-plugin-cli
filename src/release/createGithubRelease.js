 * @brief Helper for building a release (used by pkp-plugin release command)
 *
 * This helper performs these actions:
 * - Prompts the user to confirm they want to create a release on Github
 * - Opens the URL for Github release prepopulated with the release info
 * - Waits for the user to confirm they have published the release
 * 
 * @notes 
 * - We can not automatically know when the user has published the release so we require manual confirmation
 *  - using open({wait: true}) could be used but it triggers when the browser is closed (not the tab),
 *  also it does not work on windows
